This is a load test to determine Allocation QPS over time against a set of GameServers that are constantly being shutdown after a period.

This test creates a configured amount of GameServers at the initial step, switches them to Allocated state and finally shuts them down (`automaticShutdownDelayMin` flag in a simple-udp).

1) Run kubectl apply -f ./fleet.yaml
2) Run `runAllocation.sh` script to perform this test. You can provide a number of runs as a parameter (3 is a default value). There is a 500 seconds pause after each run.

To run this test under normal conditions the number of replicas in the yaml file should be >= numberOfClients * reqPerClient

# Load Test for allocation service

This load tests aims to validate performance of allocation service.

## Kubernetes Cluster Setup

For the load test you can follow the regular Kubernetes and Agones setup. In order to test the the allocation performance in isolation, we let the Agones to actuate all
the game servers beefor starting the test.
Here are the few important things:
- Install Kubernetes in a region not zone to avoid being impacted by the rollouts
- Consider using multiple cpu VMs for the agones-system node pool. We used n1-4 type VMs 
- In the default-node pool (where the Game Server pods are created), make sure there are enough nodes available so Agones can actuate the game servers. We set the clustre count to 25 pre zonee (total of 75 per region)

## Configuring the Allocator Service

The allocator service uses gRPC. In order to be able to call the service, TLS and optionally mTLS has to be setup.

## Fleet Setting

We used the following fleet configuration during out testing. It creates 4000 simple-udp game servers. 
Also uaing the automaticShutdownDelayMin parameter to 10, simple-udp game servers shutdown after 10 minutes.
This helps to easily re-run the test without requiring to delete the game servers. 

```yaml
apiVersion: "agones.dev/v1"

spec:

## Configuring the Allocator Service

The allocator service uses gRPC. In order to be able to call the service, TLS and optionally mTLS has to be setup.
For more information visit [agones-allocator]({{< relref "https://agones.dev/site/docs/advanced/allocator-service/">}}).

## Running the test

You can use the provided run.sh file. Before you run, you need to update the values in run.sh

```
NAMESPACE=default      # Namescape of the fleet
EXTERNAL_IP=<IP_ADRESSS_TO_THE_ALLOCATOR_SERVICES_LOAD_BALANCER>
KEY_FILE=client.key    # Path to mTLS client key file 
CERT_FILE=client.crt   # Path to mTLS client cert file
TLS_CA_FILE=ca.crt     # Path to TLS CA file
```
Once you update these values, you can run the run.sh script by providing two parameters: 
- number of clients (to do parallel allocations)
- numbre of allocations for client

For making 4000 allocations call, you can provide 40 and 100

```
./run.sh 40 100
```

Script will print out the start and end date/time:
```
started: 2020-10-22 23:33:25.828724579 -0700 PDT m=+0.005921014
finished: 2020-10-22 23:34:18.381396416 -0700 PDT m=+52.558592912
```

If some errors occurred, the error message will be printed:
