# Super Tux Kart Example

Example using a [Super Tux Kart](https://supertuxkart.net/) dedicated game server.

This example wraps the Super Tux Kart server with a [Go](https://golang.org) binary, and introspects
the log file to provide the event hooks for the SDK integration.

It is not a direct integration, but is an approach for to integrate with existing
dedicated game servers.

You will need to download the Super Tux Kart client separately to play.
